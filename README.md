# Unreally - MVP
This repository contains the front-end of the Unreally application. The MVP is designed to allow users to submit claims or news articles contained in a pdf and receive an evaluation indicating the likelihood of the article being fake or real. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is intended to be a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the application.
